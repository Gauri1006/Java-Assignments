✅ Assignment 1
Student Class Design & Basic Operations

This assignment introduces the basic structure of a Student Record System using classes, constructors, and arrays/ArrayLists.

✔ Features:

Student class with fields: rollNo, name, course, marks, grade

Default & parameterized constructors

Methods:

inputDetails()

displayDetails()

calculateGrade()

Menu-driven program

Storing multiple student objects using an ArrayList

🎯 Learning Outcomes:

Fundamentals of OOP

Constructors & methods

Arrays and strings

Conditional logic and loops

✅ Assignment 2
Inheritance, Interfaces & Modular Design

The system is redesigned using advanced OOP concepts including abstract classes, interfaces, and method overriding/overloading.

✔ Features:

Person (abstract) → base class

Student → extends Person

RecordActions → interface for CRUD operations

StudentManager → implements RecordActions

Prevent duplicate roll numbers

Demonstrates method overriding & overloading

🎯 Learning Outcomes:

Inheritance

Abstract classes & interfaces

Polymorphism

Package-based modular programming

✅ Assignment 3
Exception Handling, Custom Exceptions & Multithreading

This version adds robust error handling and threaded loading simulation.

✔ Features:

Validation with try-catch-finally

Custom exception: StudentNotFoundException

Loader class implementing Runnable

Simulated delay using multithreading (Thread.sleep())

Use of wrapper classes (Integer, Double) and autoboxing

🎯 Learning Outcomes:

Exception handling

Creating & using custom exceptions

Multithreading basics

Wrapper classes and data conversion

✅ Assignment 4
File Handling & Collections Framework

This version focuses on persistent storage and advanced Java collections.

✔ Features:

Read & write student data from students.txt

Uses BufferedReader & BufferedWriter

ArrayList for storing records

Sorting using Comparator & Comparable

Displaying data with Iterator

Using RandomAccessFile for random record reading

🎯 Learning Outcomes:

File handling

Working with List & Map collections

Sorting mechanisms

Iterators & data traversal

File attributes with the File class

✅ Assignment 5
Complete Capstone: OOP + Exceptions + File I/O + Multithreading + Collections

The final assignment is a fully-enhanced Student Management System combining all concepts learned so far.

✔ Features:

Person (abstract) → Student → StudentManager

Full CRUD operations

File I/O for persistent data storage

Exception handling, input validation & custom exceptions

Sorting by marks (Comparator)

Displaying sorted data using Iterator

Multithreaded loading animation

Uses List & Map for storage

Structured package-based design

🎯 Learning Outcomes:

Complete OOP architecture

Realistic multi-module Java application

Exception-safe and thread-safe programming

Persistent storage system

Collections-based data management
